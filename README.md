# 🧮 Calculator

A basic, browser-based calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

You can use it for simple math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It handles input, updates a display, and includes features like clearing, chaining operations, and a snarky message if you try to divide by zero.
